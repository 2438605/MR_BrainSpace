First, let's look at the left cerebral hemisphere. #line:06f7d2c 
This part of your brain helps you with language, logic, and analytical thinking. #line:01435b0 
It controls the movement and sensation on the right side of your body. #line:0e79c1e 
Did you know? Most people use their left hemisphere for language, especially if they're right-handed! #line:07145cd

<<highlight_right Script_manager >>
Now, let's move to the right cerebral hemisphere. #line:08ef98a 
This side is great for creativity, spatial awareness, and understanding emotions. #line:0439a12 
It helps you recognize faces and interpret non-verbal cues, like sarcasm. #line:04a7d5e 
The right hemisphere controls the left side of your body and is excellent at seeing the big picture. #line:01f5307

<<highlight_cerebellum Script_manager >>
Finally, let's discover the cerebellum. #line:0c4ad23 
The cerebellum is located at the lower back of your brain. #line:05f6653 
It keeps your movements smooth and coordinated, helps you balance, and even assists with learning new motor skills. #line:0127a66 
Despite its small size, the cerebellum is packed with neurons and is vital for most physical activities. #line:0d49a44
